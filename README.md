## 📸 Setting Up Your Images

1. Create a folder under `public/comparison-images/`
2. Add your images to this folder

Example structure:
```
public/
  comparison-images/
    diagen-process/
      image1.png
      image2.png
      ...
```

### Need Images to Compare?

Use [diagen](https://github.com/SouthBridgeAI/diagen) to generate beautiful diagrams:
```bash
npx diagen <source file>
```
This will create a set of diagrams that you can then compare using this tool!

## 🎯 How It Works

This tool uses [eloranker](https://github.com/SouthBridgeAI/eloranker) to implement an image-optimized Elo rating system. Originally developed for chess rankings, the Elo rating system has been adapted here for image comparison.

### The Math Behind It (Simplified)
- Each image starts with a base rating (1500)
- When two images are compared:
  - Winner gains points
  - Loser loses points
  - The amount of points exchanged depends on the difference in their current ratings
- The more comparisons, the more accurate the rankings become!

## 🎮 Using the Tool

1. Select your dataset from the home screen
2. Compare images using:
   - ⬆️ Up arrow or "Top Wins" button for top image
   - ⬇️ Down arrow or "Bottom Wins" button for bottom image
   - ⬅️ Left arrow or "Tie" button if they're equal

### Pro Tips
- Use the collapsible sidebar to see live ranking updates
- Watch the progress bar to see how close you are to a stable ranking
- Zoom in on images for detailed comparison
- Download your results anytime:
  - Rankings data: Final positions and scores
  - Win/Loss data: Complete comparison history
